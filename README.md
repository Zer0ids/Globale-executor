# Globale Executor
### What is Globale?
Globale is a well-known server-sided executor that has been worked on for a long time until now, there is finally a server-sided executor!

Most executors are just dumbfoundedly client-sided in which that most scripts are for. ***You*** can only see and impact the game's stuff.
But now, **we** or **I** (at least) have a server-sided one!

### How long did it take for you to build this?
It didn't take that long to build. I "borrowed" the Roblox execute remote event. Then I created the gui and stuff...

### What scripts can it hold?
I don't really know... I know the fact that it can't use, **"LocalPlayer"** and other functions. For "local player", you would have to do your **username** instead...

## Other Info

Here are the ***scripts*** that I have so far (that are public):
* [Try to Die UI](https://rscripts.net/script/Try-to-Die-Script-Script-or-Auto-Win,-Skip-Level-&-MORE-2798)
